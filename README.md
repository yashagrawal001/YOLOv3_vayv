Model Development and Improvement Report

Due to time constraints, the model training couldnâ€™t be completed. However, key elements such as 
the chosen loss function, metrics, and proposed improvement strategies have been identified.
Loss Function:
Binary cross-entropy has been selected as the loss function due to its suitability for binary 
classification tasks.
Metrics:
Mean Average Precision (MAP) will be used to evaluate model performance, providing insight into 
its ranking accuracy.
Improvement Strategies:
1. Exploration of Alternate Loss Functions
2. Evaluation of Alternative Metrics
3. Hyperparameter Tuning
4. Data Augmentation and Regularization
Conclusion:
Though incomplete, the groundwork has been laid for future model enhancement, focusing on 
optimizing performance through strategic adjustments and evaluation
